# Greetings `Nomo` Colleagues 👋

`while` reviewing GitHub [2023-07-05] I noticed that _both_ [`Nomo Bank`](https://github.com/nomobank) & [`Nomo Fintech`]() orgs did not exist! 😮
To avoid a bad actor creating the org and "squatting", I've created them proactively and will gladly transfer them to the appropriate person @Nomo on request.
When I was working there you were using `GitLab`, guessing that's still the case. 🙈

You know how to [contact me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nelsonic/).


Fun fact while on a recent trip to Germany I discovered [nomochoc.com](https://nomochoc.com/collections/vegan-chocolate-bars) 🍫

Which you should totally include in your welcome pack!
